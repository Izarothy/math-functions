This is a personal math project that'll likely be published as an NPM package and made interactive on a website.
I'm converting math concepts to code representations to automatize and fool-proof my math skills.
As of now, it covers a part of analytical geometry.

Tech stack is currently only TypeScript that I run with the ts-node package.
